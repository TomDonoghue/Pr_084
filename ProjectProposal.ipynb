    "Our team likes beer, and we also travel. It’s interesting to us how different the varieties of available beer are in other countries and how America’s newfound love for beer has made the craft brewing scene evolve differently than it did in other regions of the world. Since America itself is a large country and has different cultures within it, we’re wondering if different parts of the United States have differing preferences for style of beer. We know IPA’s are huge on the West Coast, but is that true in other states as well?\n",

We also found a cool interactive map that was made by a team at University of Kentucky which actually measures popularity of the types of beers by scraping tweets. The issue with that tool is that it’s based off of social media hype which does not necessarily indicate what’s available on the market. Additionally, it isn’t as easy to identify which styles are most prominent since the available tags include styles such as “Weiss” but also specific brands like “Corona.” This means that it includes non-craft beers.\n",

    "\tWe will use the methods learned in class to create cleaner beer data. The data looks like it has been cleaned before since  it does not seem to have many Nans, and does not have outliers nor inconsistent numbers. However, in order to classify styles of beer, we will probably have to manually group different styles that are overly-specific in the dataset. For example, “Oatmeal Stout” and “Coffee Stout” are too granular for what we want and would likely group them under a “Stout” category. We will also need to move the location data from the breweries.csv file into the beers.csv file and expand that one.\n",

We are joining these two datasets to determine which state the brewers are in. Then, we will sum the types of beers within each state and mark the largest sum as the most popular.

We promise to not include personal biases on beers and/or exclude beers for any reason that would affect the ethics of this project. Any impact and issues that result from our analysis will not be made public and are for the purpose of this class and ourselves only.

    "Our project will utilize datasets representing a wide variety of beers and breweries present in the United States. We are very interested in beer preferences within groups and believe that preferences might be heavily influenced by the location of the individual. With the recent phenomenon of craft beer in the USA, we are interested in studying the patterns of behavior exhibited by populations. We hope that we will be able to create a map of the country depicting the most popular types of beers in specific geographical regions. This might lead to a better understanding of different regional preferences. We particularly feel that states outside of California have more diversity and aren’t as saturated with just IPA’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we hypothesize the most popular beer is the Indian Pale Ale and that the variety is greater outside of California. Whether or not our hypothesis is correct, we’re more interested in exploring the distributions of styles and trends across regions as a whole. Most similar research just tries to look at the craft beer movement as a whole or compares different brands. We will contribute by looking at which styles are most popular in America and break it down by region, something we have not really seen. The dataset, while it will need some cleaning does not seem like it will pose any major issues in helping us answer our question, but we may have to get creative with how we visualize the comparison of different styles of beer by state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data we could find only consists of canned beers, there is a possibility that the trends we see do not fully apply to the craft movement as a whole. We’re willing to work with this caveat because beer in a can is not seen as negatively as it once was, and the canned form especially seems to be welcomed in the craft beer community. Therefore, we believe that the 2,000+ canned beers are mostly representative of the craft beer market as a whole.\n"
