    "Our team likes beer, and we also travel. It’s interesting to us how different the varieties of available beer are in other countries and how America’s newfound love for beer has made the craft brewing scene evolve differently than it did in other regions of the world. Since America itself is a large country and has different cultures within it, we’re wondering if different parts of the United States have differing preferences for style of beer. We know IPA’s are huge on the West Coast, but is that true in other states as well?\n",
    "\n",
    "We found inspiration from an interesting study by Brewer’s Association that looks at number of craft breweries by state and has some general stats showing trends of how popular craft beer is in general. We also found a cool interactive map that was made by a team at University of Kentucky which actually measures popularity of the types of beers by scraping tweets. The issue with that tool is that it’s based off of social media hype which does not necessarily indicate what’s available on the market. Additionally, it isn’t as easy to identify which styles are most prominent since the available tags include styles such as “Weiss” but also specific brands like “Corona.” This means that it includes non-craft beers.\n",

    "Our project will utilize datasets representing a wide variety of beers and breweries present in the United States. We are very interested in beer preferences within groups and believe that preferences might be heavily influenced by the location of the individual. With the recent phenomenon of craft beer in the USA, we are interested in studying the patterns of behavior exhibited by populations. We hope that we will be able to create a map of the country depicting the most popular types of beers in specific geographical regions. This might lead to a better understanding of different regional preferences. We particularly feel that states outside of California have more diversity and aren’t as saturated with just IPA’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we hypothesize the most popular beer is the Indian Pale Ale and that the variety is greater outside of California. Whether or not our hypothesis is correct, we’re more interested in exploring the distributions of styles and trends across regions as a whole. Most similar research just tries to look at the craft beer movement as a whole or compares different brands. We will contribute by looking at which styles are most popular in America and break it down by region, something we have not really seen. The dataset, while it will need some cleaning does not seem like it will pose any major issues in helping us answer our question, but we may have to get creative with how we visualize the comparison of different styles of beer by state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data we could find only consists of canned beers, there is a possibility that the trends we see do not fully apply to the craft movement as a whole. We’re willing to work with this caveat because beer in a can is not seen as negatively as it once was, and the canned form especially seems to be welcomed in the craft beer community. Therefore, we believe that the 2,000+ canned beers are mostly representative of the craft beer market as a whole.\n"
